# Browser Proving

## Status And Scope

The destination-bound browser prover is implemented and locally accepted in
the production claim flow. Hosted enablement is still controlled entirely by
the deployment manifest's `proof.browser_proving` descriptor; absent or
disabled descriptors fail closed and keep Proof Helper Desktop available.

The browser provider changes where the same destination proof is computed. It
does not change the circuit, proof artifact, Cardano bytes, verifier key, or
contract semantics.

## Runtime Map

- `cmd/wasm-prover`: main Go WASM entrypoint. Registers `proveDestination`,
  `preflightProofAssets`, and `__wasmProverReady`.
- `cmd/msmworker`: Go WASM MSM kernel used by nested workers.
- `internal/streampk`: proving-key section index and file/HTTP range source.
- `internal/streamprove`: streaming Groth16 adapter.
- `internal/msmengine`: CPU fallback, sharded worker transport, authenticated
  section fetch, pinned point decoding, scheduling, and trace hooks.
- `internal/proofassets`: signed chunk-manifest generation and validation.
- `apps/ownership-proof-web/public/proof-runtime/prover-worker.js`: dedicated
  proof-worker orchestrator.
- `apps/ownership-proof-web/public/proof-runtime/msm-worker.js`: nested MSM
  worker bootstrap.
- `apps/ownership-proof-web/lib/proving/capability.ts`: cheap browser
  capability checks.
- `apps/ownership-proof-web/lib/proving/browser-wasm.ts`: claim-provider
  preflight, sequential batch
  proving, cancellation, result gates, and error redaction.
- `experiments/wasm-prover`: benchmark harness and diagnostics for the same
  production packages; it is not a second production implementation.

## Execution Flow

The claim UI checks capability and signed assets before reading the recovery
phrase. The prover worker loads `wasm_exec.js` and `proof-destination.wasm`, then
the Go preflight validates:

- key-manifest schema, signature, key version, circuit ID, and VK identity;
- chunk-manifest signature and coherence with the key/deployment manifests;
- CCS, VK, PK index, runtime WASM, worker JS, and worker WASM hashes/sizes;
- deployment ID and final `vk_hash` equality with the claim deployment.

During proving, the main worker derives/searches locally and sends scalar
material plus signed section/range descriptors to nested MSM workers. Workers
fetch public PK chunks, verify SHA-256 and BLAKE2b-256, decode pinned on-curve
points, compute partial MSMs, zero scalar buffers, and return only partial
results and timing data. The generated proof is verified locally before the
provider returns an artifact.

Proof requests in a claim batch run sequentially in one long-lived worker.
Parallel proofs would exceed reasonable memory. Cancellation terminates the Go
worker because an individual WASM MSM is not cooperatively cancellable.

## Secret Boundary

The phrase is normalized and converted to a 96-byte master XPrv in a local
derivation worker. Browser proving moves the XPrv into the dedicated prover
worker and never fetches a hosted API with it. Request JSON containing
`master_xprv_hex` must not be logged, thrown, persisted, included in progress,
or surfaced in diagnostics. The caller zeros its master byte array in
`finally`; the worker is terminated after use.

Only public, signed proof assets cross the network. Proof artifacts omit path
metadata and must still pass the claim backend's recomputation and VK gates.

## Accepted Tuning And Evidence

`apps/ownership-proof-web/lib/proving/browser-wasm.ts` defaults to the measured
production route:

```text
worker_count:            8
shard_count:             32
range_fetch_concurrency: 2
pinned_decode:           true
GOGC:                    50
GOMEMLIMIT:              3000MiB
```

The accepted local O4/O2 run used `streampk-sharded-groth16`, completed proof
construction in 111.461 seconds (115.900 seconds wall time), peaked at 2.316
GiB main WASM heap, verified locally, and passed tamper rejection for the target
credential, destination, public input, proof bytes, and `vk_hash`.

Pinned decode skips redundant subgroup checks only for digest-authenticated PK
chunks and still performs on-curve validation. Commitment Basis and
BasisExpSigma use section-backed MSMs; WASM GC/memory-limit enforcement is
temporarily suspended only around the solver to avoid the observed wasm32
bad-pointer failure, then restored. `computeH` and scalar preparation overlap
worker-bound stages without changing proof challenges.

## Dependency Strategy

Upstream gnark v0.15.0 does not expose the required BLS12-381 `ProveStream`
seam. The reviewed additive patch is
`experiments/wasm-prover/patches/prove-stream.patch`. `vendor/` must equal a
clean `go mod vendor` plus that patch:

```bash
scripts/bootstrap-vendor.sh
scripts/check-vendor-drift.sh
```

Never run plain `go mod vendor` and commit or build silently; it removes the
streaming seam. Moving to a reviewed fork/upstream change remains preferable
for a final production provenance story.

## Build And Verification

Build reproducible runtime files:

```bash
scripts/build-wasm-prover.sh
```

Run correctness checks:

```bash
go test ./internal/msmengine ./internal/streampk ./internal/streamprove ./internal/proofassets
GOROOT="$(go env GOROOT)" N=2000 WORKERS=4 \
  node experiments/wasm-prover/web/node-msm-check/run.mjs
node experiments/wasm-prover/scripts/verify-tamper.mjs \
  experiments/wasm-prover/output/o4-o2-section-commitment-w8-s32-rf2-local7-artifact.json
```

Run a guarded benchmark only on an otherwise idle host and compare
uncontaminated summaries:

```bash
node experiments/wasm-prover/scripts/guarded-browser-benchmark.mjs \
  --case local-check --workers 8 --shards 32 --rf 2 --cpu-list 0-15
```

See `browser-proving-asset-hosting.md` for asset generation/staging and
`vercel-preprod-browser-proving-deployment-plan.md` for the still-open hosted
rollout.

## Further Optimization

The durable results/backlog is `experiments/wasm-prover/optimization-backlog.md`.
Do not accept a tuning change from compile-only or microbenchmark evidence: it
must produce a real destination proof, verify locally, pass tamper tests,
preserve artifact/Cardano bytes, record uncontaminated trace evidence, and stay
within the approved memory envelope.
